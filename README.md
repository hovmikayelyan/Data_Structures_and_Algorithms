# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
Completed Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization conducted by UC San Diego offered via #coursera.

If you're looking for a career in Software Engineering, you need to be good at problem-solving skills. In other words, you can't evade learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
The specialization "Data Structures and Algorithms" on Coursera is an amazing resource to develop this skill.

It was an amazing hands-on learning experience thanks to such a well-structured specialization. Lots of new concepts and methodologies with real world applications.
Between the combination of passing and failing grades, confusion and certainty of concepts, lies a true sense of accomplishment. I think this is real progress.

Always upskilling & upscaling!
